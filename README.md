## Design Decision

For Backend:
NodeJs - Node.js is easily employed as a server-side proxy where it can handle a large amount of simultaneous connections in a non-blocking manner. It is especially useful for proxying different services with varying response times, or collecting data from multiple source points

For Frontend: 
React and Redux : Using React to make the ui/ux development easier, making components of the application. Introduced redux into the application to manage global state of the application, redux helps applications like SPA to transfer and manage UI states from one component to another.

For UI Library:
Mantine UI: Used Mantine UI to make UI/UX development easier, help in managing the states of the UI and also help in development of robust UI. It also helps manage modal system and notifications system.

For Database/ORM:
MySQL: MySQL provides comprehensive support for this application development. It also supports for the stored procedures, triggers, functions, views if needed. The structure of the table which is to be used is going to be structured and well defined and so MySQL would be suitable database to be used. 

DB Design use cases to keep in mind:
1. 3 categories of users: Airlines employee, Airport Employee, Users to access the System with role based authentication
2. Retrieve Flight arrivals and departure and get assignments based on time.
3. Implement a random gate assignment for arriving and departure flights- designed to prevent conflict assignments.
4. Airport Employees: Enable or disable one or more gates for maintenance
5. Airport Employees: Assign baggage carousel number to arriving flights - the system should prevent conflicting assignments
6. Display Baggage claim information will be displayed in multiple monitors in the arrival area.
7. Airline Employees: Add or update the schedule of flights belonging to their airline relevant to that airport
